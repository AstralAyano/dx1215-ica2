                    <p><i>Dungeons & Dragons</i> is a fantasy tabletop role-playing game originally designed by Ernest Gary Gygax and David Arneson.</p>
                    <p>
                        It was published in <span class="date">1974</span> by Tactical Studios Rules, company owned by Gygax. 
                        Later on published by Wizards of the Coast since <span class="date">1997</span>.</p>

                    <p>
                        Originally it was a set of medieval miniature rules written by Jeff Perren. These were expanded by Gary Gygax, that included a fantasy supplement, 
                        before the game was published as <i>Chainmail</i>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When Dave Wesely entered the Army in <span class="date">1970</span>, his friend, Dave Arneson a fellow Napoleonics wargamer began a medieval variation of Wesely's Braunstein games,
                        where players control individuals instead of armies.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Arneson used <i>Chainmail</i> to resolve the combat mechanics. As play progressed, Arneson added such innovations as 
                        character classes, experience points, level advancement, armor class, and others.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As Arneson previously partnered with Gygax on <i>Don't Give Up the Ship!</i>, Arneson introduced Gygas to his Blackmoor game and the two then collaborated on
                        developing "The Fantasy Game", and that game became <i>Dungeons & Dragons</i>, with the final writing and preparation of the text being done by Gygax.

                    <p>In 1989, Advanced Dungeons & Dragons <span class="edition">2nd Edition</span> was published, it excluded some aspects of the original game that had attracted negative publicity.
                        Such as references to demons and devils, sexually suggestive artwork, and playable, evil-aligned character types (assassins and half-orcs) were removed.
                    </p>
                    <p>The <span class="edition">2nd Edition</span> also moved away from the "sword and sorcery" fantasy fiction to a mixture of medieval history and mythology.</p>

                        After three years of development, Dungeons & Dragons <span class="edition">3rd Edition</span> was released in 2000. 
                        The <span class="edition">3rd Edition</span> was the largest revision of the D&D rules to date and served as the basis for a multi-genre role-playing system designed around
                        20-sided dice, called the d20 System.

                        The <span class="edition">3rd Edition</span> was designed to be less restrictive than previous editions, allowing players more flexibility to create the characters '
                        they wanted to play. Skills and feats (features) were also introduced into the core rules to allow further customisation of characters.

                        In early <span class="date">2005</span>, Wizards of the Coast's Research & Development team started the development of <i>Dungeons & Dragons</i> <span class="edition">4th Edition</span>,
                        mostly based on the feedback obtained from the D&D playing community, with a desire to make the game faster, more intuitive, and with a better play experience than under the

                        After going through numerous design phases since <span class="date">May 2005</span>, <i>Dungeons & Dragons</i> <span class="edition">4th Edition</span> was announced at Gen Con 
                        in <span class="date">August 2007</span>. <span class="edition">4th Edition</span> introduced numerous rules changes and most of the characters abilities were restructured into "Powers", 
                        whereby it altered the spell-using classes by adding abilities that could be used at will, per encounter, or per day. Likewise, non-magic classes also had parallel sets of options.

                        On <span class="date">January 9, 2012</span>, Wizards of the Coast announced that it was working on a <span class="edition">5th Edition</span> of the game. And the strategy was to 
                        take suggestions from players and let them playtest the rules. Public playtesting began on <span class="date">May 24, 2012</span>, and had already received 75,000 playtesters 
                        feedback in a single month. This lead to the decision of announcing that it would take at least two years of development to seriously get it right.

                        to 15 million in <span class="date">2017</span> North America. As time goes on, <i>Dungeons & Dragons</i> have become more accessible to everyone world-wide through the use of 
                        internet, using a very popular official <i>Dungeons & Dragons</i> website called DNDBeyond.

                        <i>Dungeons & Dragons</i> has evolved a lot throughout the years, but it still stays true to its fantasy style aspect. And it has grown so much that countless amounts of 
                        campaigns or worlds has been created. From your typical medieval fantasy genre to even a futuristic science fiction genre, or even a remake of existing stories, worlds or shows.

                        When it comes to playing <i>Dungeons & Dragons</i>, it requires one Dungeon Master (DM) and Player(s). It may seem a bit intimidating but I assure you, it isn't and you don't 
                        have to follow every single rules in the rulebooks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So gather some friends! And get ready to play.

                    <p>
                        As the <span class="edition">Dungeon Master</span>, the first step is having a Session 0. Gather all your party members, sit down, and have a talk about what everyone wants to play, 
                        The style of game? Genre? Medieval or futuristic? Note down every player's opinion, find a easy simple campaign to start it off!

                    <p>
                        Once decided you can proceed with character creation. There are plety of guides on how to create a D&D Character, so don't be shy and search it up! Help your players with 
                        anything they don't understand.

                    <p>
                        As the <span class="edition">Player</span>, you don't have to let your DM do all the work, you can also search up some basic informations, such as, what type of class do you want to play? What race? 
                        Is your character good? or evil? Write it down, this can help your DM guide you through easier and helps offload some work from the DM!
